This is my project repo for ECSE 682 (VLSI Signal Processing) at McGill in Fall 2015. The project is about hardware implementations of the FastICA algorithm for blind source separation.

Here's a great tutorial on FastICA by its inventors: http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~yuille/courses/Stat161-261-Spring14/HyvO00-icatut.pdf
